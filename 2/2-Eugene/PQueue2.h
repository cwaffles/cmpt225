//Description:
//A data collection Priority Queue ADT class. This class ***must
//not*** print anything on the computer monitor screen. Name this
//class PQueue (PQueue.h and PQueue.cpp). A priority queue keeps
//its elements in a particular "priority" sort order. Its peek
//operation peeks at the element with the "highest" priority and
//its dequeue operation removes the element with the "highest"
//priority. Note that "highest" priority does not always mean
//largest value.

//Arrival events and departure events are ordered by time, and we always want to remove and
//process the next event that should occurâ€”the highest-priority event. The ADT priority queue is
//used in this way. Our events can be stored in the priority queue eventListPQueue . We can initialize
//eventListPQueue with the arrival events in the simulation data fi le and later add the departure
//events as they are generated.

//time of departure = time service begins + length of transaction
