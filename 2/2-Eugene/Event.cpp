//Description:
//stores the details of a bank customer event

//An Event class as described in Section 13.4. It must be designed and
//implemented as an ADT and have getters and setters for the attributes
//"type", "time" and "length". This class ***must not*** print anything
//on the computer monitor screen. Name this class Event (Event.h and Event.cpp).

//Class Invariant: Type must be 'A' or 'D', time and length attributes cannot be negative

/*private attributes/methods

	char type; //Event type, either A or D
	unsigned int time; //Time of customer arrival
	unsigned int length; //Length of time it takes to process the event
