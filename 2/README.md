#Assignment #2 - Bank Simulation

Problem Statement

In this Assignment 2, we are to design and implement an event-driven bank simulation application. The problem statement we are solving in this assignment is described in Programming Problem 6 of Chapter 13 of our textbook and in its Section 13.4.

Note: Before we dive into this assignment, let's first read Programming Problem 6 and Section 13.4 of Chapter 13.

* Simulation.in provides Event start time and processing time in 2 columns

* Queue ADT must use array based structure (no resize function necessary)

* Priority Queue must uses a linked-list based structure
