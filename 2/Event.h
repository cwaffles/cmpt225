//Description:
//stores the details of a bank customer event

//An Event class as described in Section 13.4. It must be designed and
//implemented as an ADT and have getters and setters for the attributes
//"type", "time" and "length". This class ***must not*** print anything
//on the computer monitor screen. Name this class Event (Event.h and Event.cpp).
