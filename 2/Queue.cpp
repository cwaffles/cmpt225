// Description:
//A data collection Queue ADT class. This class ***must not*** print anything
//on the computer monitor screen. Name this class Queue (Queue.h and Queue.cpp).
//Use an array-based implementation for this Queue class and make sure our
//implementation abides to its Public Interface described below (expressed in C++):

//bankQueue represents the line of customers in the bank, and stores events of in the order that they were received
//As customers arrive, they go to the back of the
//line. The current customer, who was at the front of the line, is being served, and it is this customer that
//you remove from the system next. It is thus natural to use a queue, bankQueue, to represent the line of
//customers in the bank. For this problem, the only information that you must store in the queue about
//each customer is the time of arrival and the length of the transaction.

#include "Queue.h"

//Class invariants: FIFO or LILO

//private attributes:

//int queueCount; //how many items are currently in the queue. Default value is -1
//
//unsigned int queueMax; //keeps track of the maximum elements that can be stored in the queue
//
//Event* queueElements; //array of events in the queue

// Description: default constructor for an empty queue
